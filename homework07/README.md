# Descriptive statistics with SQL, Pandas, R
## This is the seventh assignment of the "Introduction to Python" course by [Dementiy](https://github.com/Dementiy)
### What do you learn in this assignment?
* work w/ Jupyter Notebook
* work w/ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* pandas module
* psycopg2 module
* postgreSQL queries
* R language basics
---
The [description](https://github.com/Dementiy/old-Dementiy.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2017-11-22-11-descriptive-statistics.markdown) of the assignment:
1. Install Docker and start a container with postgresql according to this [article](https://ryaneschinger.com/blog/dockerized-postgresql-development-environment/)
2. Create a database in that container and fill it with data like in the assignment template
3. Do the SQL task by making queries to your database (which must be turned on in Docker) from your Python IDE w/ psycopg2 module
4. Do the tasks for [olympics](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/download) dataset using Pandas (the tasks are in the assignment's template)
5. Do the tasks for [flights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UZXzfwhKe0gJ9JbuxJbrCsFnLpOnxHgZ/view?usp=sharing) dataset using Pandas (the tasks are in the assignment's template)
6. Install R Studio for making Jupyter Notebook work with R lang
7. Do the same tasks for both datasets but using R lang with its 'dplyr' and 'plotly' modules

###### Notes:
The task may slightly change over time, therefore, my assignment might be not up-to-date
The [inititial](https://github.com/Dementiy/old-Dementiy.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2017-11-22-11-descriptive-statistics.markdown) description of the task is scarce, so I decided to add it myself
